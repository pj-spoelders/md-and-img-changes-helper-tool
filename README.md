# text-and-file-changer
A simple tool to facilitate image filename changes in a repository's markdown files.
## Purpose
The idea behind this tool is when you need to change image names in md files this gets finicky. You got to alter them manually and it's error prone and very 'not fun'.
This takes the finicky part out of it and makes it not error prone
## Additional feature: finding 'floating' images.
The tool also lists 'floating' images not used in any of the .md files in the repository.
